# DepoboxTool
This box model can be easily used, modified, and distributed throughout the research community to help translate between deposition models and measurements.
The box model currently provides four essential functions including dry deposition scheme evaluation, diagnostics, sensitivity analysis, and model inter-comparison. Further, it can easily incorporate different land-use categories when corresponding parameters are available.
